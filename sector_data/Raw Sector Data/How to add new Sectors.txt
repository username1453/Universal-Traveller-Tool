How to add new sectors:

Go to the traveller map website and access the source code download.
In the source code on GitHub, go through the res file for the milleu you want.
(I used 1105 as my base)
Inside the milleu download the .tab file for the sector you want
The .tab file is unusable, but it can be converted through the data wizard funtion in excel
(data tab, import text, sort for all file types, select then save as a new excel sheet)
